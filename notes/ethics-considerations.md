Ethics Considerations

This project does not involve surveillance, monitoring, or evaluation of real student submissions. All data used in experiments will not be synthetically generated, written by the researcher, or produced using generative AI under controlled conditions.

No attempts are made to bypass institutional safeguards, deceive detection systems, or deploy the proposed techniques in real academic environments. The intent of this study is analytical and evaluative, not adversarial.

The project frames generative AI as a tool with identifiable limitations rather than as an adversary. Findings are intended to inform assessment design and pedagogical practice, not to justify punitive enforcement mechanisms.
